# Hangman Game in Python

## Introduction 

This project is a simple text-based Hangman game implemented in Python. One letter at a time, the player must guess the word that the game randomly selects from an existing list.  The objective of the project is to illustrate basic concepts in Python programming, including classes, functions, and control structures.

During the development of this project, I learned about the basic principles of user interaction and game design. Project debugging and refactoring for cleaner more optimised code and implementation of python classes and methods 

## Installation Instructions 

To play the Hangman game, you need to have Python installed on your computer. Once installed, you can download the source code for the Hangman game from this repository.
